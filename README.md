Never work on the main branch, if you want to develop: 
1. Make a branch off of the development branch, name the branch
2. Push directly to that branch.
3. Once you have finished work on that branch, create a merge request to the Development branch.
4. Every now and then (at particular milestones) we will merge the Development branch into the Main branch.
